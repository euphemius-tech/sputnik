- Detailed examples of backend integrations.
- Interaction with multiple types of databases.
- Implementation of background jobs and caching.

## Technology Stack

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Sidekiq

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq. Ensure these are installed and properly configured on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shliamin/Rails-Sputnik.git
   cd Rails-Sputnik
   ```
2. Install the required gems:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

   ### Usage

The Sputnik application is designed to demonstrate complex backend operations including database interactions, job queues, and caching mechanisms. Here's how you can interact with it:

1. **Accessing the Web Interface:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the main interface.
   - Utilize the UI to interact with various backend functionalities.

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - Send requests to RESTful endpoints documented in `routes.rb` to test API interactions.
   - Example: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resources`

3. **Background Jobs:**
   - Trigger background jobs via the UI or directly through the Rails console.
   - Monitor job status through the Sidekiq dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/sidekiq`

4. **Database Operations:**
   - Perform CRUD operations on the database through the provided interfaces or Rails console.
   - Example database query in Rails console: `User.first`

5. **Testing Cache and Services:**
   - Test caching mechanisms by accessing repeated data requests and observing performance improvements.
   - Interact with integrated services like Redis by observing the caching of query results.

These steps will help you explore the functionalities of the Rails-Sputnik application, demonstrating real-world usage of Rails in a complex backend environment.
